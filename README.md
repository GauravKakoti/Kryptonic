# Krypt - Web 3.0 Blockchain Application

# Project Description

We are building a modern, fully responsive website that leverages the power of Web3 technology to enable users to send and receive Ethereum through our application. The website will be built using ReactJS, Solidity, TailwindCSS, Vite, Ethers, and HardHat.

Users will be able to connect their Ethereum wallet to our application using MetaMask. Once connected, they will be able to send Ethereum to other users by entering the recipient's address, the amount of Ethereum they want to send, and an optional message or keyword. Each transaction will be stored on the blockchain forever, and users will be able to view their transaction history on our website.

The website will have a clean and modern interface that is easy to navigate. The focus will be on implementing Web3 technology into our React application, enabling users to send transactions through the blockchain, and storing those transactions in our application for easy viewing.

Technical Details:

We will use ReactJS to build the frontend of our application, along with TailwindCSS for styling. Vite will be used as our bundler to improve build time and speed up development. We will use Ethers to interact with the Ethereum network and send transactions. Solidity will be used to write our smart contracts, which will handle the logic for sending and receiving Ethereum.

HardHat will be used as our development environment for testing our smart contracts before deploying them to the Ethereum network. We will also use HardHat to deploy our smart contracts to the Ethereum network.

MetaMask will be used to connect users' Ethereum wallets to our application. We will handle MetaMask's events using Ethers to trigger Ethereum transactions when a user wants to send Ethereum.

Our website will have a clean and modern interface that is easy to navigate, making it easy for users to send and receive Ethereum through our application. The website will be fully responsive, ensuring that it looks great on all devices.
